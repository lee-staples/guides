<details><summary>BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Pairing for Wattbike PRO</summary>
..
 
For your Wattbike Pro to work, it’ll need a Model B monitor that was sold after 2013. This monitor is what transmits data from your bike in either BLE or ANT+. If you’re not sure what model you have, check the back of your monitor. Prior to connecting, complete the steps below:

  * If you're looking to upgrade to a Model B, contact [Wattbike](https://wattbike.com/gb/contact).

  * Update the firmware on the Model B computer to the latest available version.

    * For Mac and Windows 7 or 8 users, you can download Wattbike's [automatic updater app](https://wattbike.com/us/downloads). For Windows 10 users, check out this tutorial [video](https://support.wattbike.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003126885-Model-B-Performance-Monitor-Firmware-Update-Windows-Manual-Method) to manually update your firmware.

  * On your Wattbike monitor, set your ANT+ channel to the combined channel called Bike Speed and Cadence and Power (SPC & PWR).
    * 	Check out Wattbike's video [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOPYkeHTOzo) if you need instructions on how to set up your Model B computer.

  * To prevent your cadence from cutting in and out, turn off the Wattbike speed/cadence ANT + stream.
    * The Wattbike will still transmit cadence as long as the power stream is turned on.

To pair your Wattbike Pro over BLE, turn on your Wattbike and follow these steps:
..

1. On your Wattbike, turn BLE on.
  * Go to *Settings*.
  * Go to *Remote*.
  * Select *Enable Bluetooth Programming Mode*.
2. On your mobile device, open the Wattbike Hub app.
3. Pair your Wattbike with your mobile device.
4. In the Wattbike Hub app, select Active.
5. Close the Wattbike Hub app.
6. On the Wattbike, select Just Ride.
7. Once in Bkool/Zwift/Sufferfest/etcera the Wattbike should appear under the Power and Cadence categories.
